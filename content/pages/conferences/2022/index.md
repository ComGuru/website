# TDWG 2022—A Hybrid Conference

# Stronger Together: Standards for linking biodiversity data

# 17–21 October 2022

Last updated 1 March 2022

<!-- Translations: ES, FR, JP -->

As borders begin to open and we continue to strengthen the connectivity of people and biodiversity data globally by virtual means, TDWG 2022 will be a hybrid conference composed of symposia, workshops, contributed oral and poster presentations, demos, and discussions, as well as keynotes and social events. Our wonderful local hosts from Sofia, Bulgaria include Pensoft Publishers, and the National Museum of Natural History and Institute of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Research both at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. They cordially invite you to experience Sofia in-person and virtually. #tdwg2022

## Registration

Registration cost will depend on in-person or virtual participation. As in past years, registration fees include a discount structure, and help to defray the cost of abstract publication. Special discounts are in place for students, post-docs, and participants from developing nations. If the cost of registration is a barrier to your participation in this conference, please contact [conf-organizers@tdwg.org](mailto:conf-organizers@tdwg.org) and briefly state why this is a barrier. Individual TDWG members and up to five representatives from [member institutions](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/#institutional%20members%202022_1) enjoy a discounted regular registration.
