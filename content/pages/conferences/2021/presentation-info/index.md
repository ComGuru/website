# Presentation Expectations

_Translations: [ES](https://tdwg.org/conferences/2021/es/info-de-presentaciones/)_

During the virtual conference week, sessions will be scheduled primarily during the time zone of our host (1100â€“2300 UTC), with most sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, and with a break between sessions. To accommodate all submissions, some parallel sessions will be scheduled. Time zone differences across our global community make it inevitable that some sessions of interest may occur well outside of normal working hours or during the middle of the night for some. The Program Committee is working to make the schedule as inclusive as possible, and to mitigate these timing difficulties, recorded presentations will be posted in a timely fashion for registered attendees.

## Contributed Oral Presentations
Contributed Oral Presentations - 10 minutes to present + 3 min. for questions + 2 min. to change presenters (total 15 min/presentation). Each presentation requires a published abstract.

## Symposia
Symposia may use the same format as Contributed Oral presentations or symposium organizers may decide to change the length of time that speakers are allowed. Symposia may include time set aside for an introduction and a discussion. Each presentation requires a published abstract.

## Workshops, panel discussions, & unconference
Workshops, the panel discussion, and the unconference may include presentations to set the stage for the session. While we encourage the submission of at least one abstract to represent each session, organizers may arrange to submit an abstract summarizing outcomes (post-conference), or to submit a longer, post-conference article (cost not included as part of registration) to the TDWG 2021 Proceedings collection.

## Posters
Posters require a published abstract, but the authors are encouraged to reimagine what their virtual posters could be while still keeping with the spirit of an entity that is self-contained and self-explanatory, emphasizing fewer words and more graphical flow of ideas. Presenters will have the opportunity to link or upload a short (<3 min) video about their poster. We encourage you to think beyond the "scientific paper as a poster" mode to combine science, art, and storytelling (e.g. [https://theoatmeal.com/comics/wombats](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/wombats)). The Whova Conference Platform offers a dedicated area we are calling "PostersPlus" for sharing these media and discussing relevant topics in a shared space.

## Plenary speakers
Plenary speakers will be chosen by the organizing committee and an abstract will be required.
