# TDWG 2021 - October 18-22 

As in 2020, TDWG 2021 must again be virtual. While biomedical scientists have made great progress against the SARS-COV-2 virus, the deployment of vaccines worldwide is very uneven.  Moreover, travel budgets at most organizations have been slashed. The Fall of 2021 is therefore still too soon to return to an in-person annual conference.  As we did last year, TDWG 2021 will be a virtual conference composed of webinar-style symposia, presentations, panel discussions, and recorded presentations. We are separating working sessions from the virtual conference, but in response to feedback from last year's conference, we will hold working sessions after the main conference. **The main conference will be held over the week of October 18-22,** and working sessions will be scheduled during the following month. The theme for this year's meeting will be:

**Connecting the world of biodiversity data: standards uniting people, processes & tools**

In our original planning, the 2021 meeting was to be hosted by the University of Florida, Gainesville and its Florida Museum of Natural History, with Dr. Pam Soltis leading the local effort. Among the lessons learned from last year's conference is that virtual events still require a lot of work, so this year we will be using the University of Florida Conference Services group to help organize and manage TDWG 2021. We will have a modest registration fee for this virtual event (discounted for students and participants from lower middle-income countries).  Abstracts for all contributions (oral presentations and virtual posters) will be published in our open access journal, Biodiversity Information Science and Standards.  Unlike last year, publication costs will _not_ be passed to authors, but defrayed by registration fees and conference sponsorships. 

In the virtual conference week, we envision a mixture of three to four 90-minute or 2 h sessions each day, separated by at least a 30 minute break. Additional presenter instructions will be posted at a later date. Although we hope to avoid concurrent sessions, the time zones differences across our global community will guarantee that some of the audience for any session will be participating outside normal working hours. Presentations will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.
