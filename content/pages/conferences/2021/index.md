# TDWG 2021<br />October 18-22 

_Last updated 14 June 2021_

_Translations: [ES](./es/), [FR](./fr)_

As we continue to connect people and biodiversity data globally by virtual means in these globally uncertain times, TDWG 2021 will be composed of symposia, workshops, contributed oral and poster presentations, demos, and discussions, as well as keynotes and social events. The Interest/Task Group working sessions will be held separately during the month following the virtual conference (November 2021). 

## Hosts

TDWG 2021 will be hosted on the virtual platform, [Whova](https://whova.com), by the University of Florida, Gainesville and the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/), with [Dr. Pam Soltis](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/soltis-lab/), Director of the [University of Florida Biodiversity Institute](https://biodiversity.research.ufl.edu/), and Research PI for [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/), leading the hosting effort. Brianna Blassneck, of the University of Florida Conference Services group, will be helping to organize and manage TDWG 2021. 

## Registration

While virtual, connecting and uniting the TDWG community for the sharing of standards, processes and tools, does not come free. This year's modest registration fee includes a discount structure, and is well worth the price. It also helps to defray the cost of abstract publication. [**Register now**](https://reg.conferences.dce.ufl.edu/Basic/1400081801)

## Abstracts

Abstracts are required for all contributions (oral presentations and virtual posters) and will be published in our open access journal, [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net/) (BISS). **The [call for abstracts](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2021/call-for-abstracts/) was released 6 June; deadline for abstract submission is 2 August.**

## Scheduling

During the virtual conference week, sessions will be scheduled primarily during the time zone of our host (1100â€“2300 UTC), with most sessions lasting 90-120 minutes, and with a break between sessions. To accommodate all submissions, some parallel sessions will be scheduled. Time zone differences across our global community make it unavoidable that some sessions of interest may occur well outside of normal working hours or during the middle of the night for some. The Program Committee is working to make the schedule as inclusive as possible, and to mitigate these timing difficulties, recorded presentations will be posted in a timely fashion.
