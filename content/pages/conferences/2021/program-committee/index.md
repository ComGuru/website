# The Program Committee for TDWG 2021

Meeting regularly on Zoom, Slack, and collaborating on Google Drive throughout 2021 from all over the world, the #TDWG2021PrgmCmte is fueled by volunteers who have called for session organizers; solicited, reviewed, and edited abstracts; explored spaces for virtual social networking; and worked on scheduling events. Some wear multiple hats; some are veterans of conference planning, others are new to the process, but all learn something new, have the chance to take a leadership role on a team, and to meet and work with new colleagues and friends.

University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, United States <br / >
Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, United States <br />
Kimberly is a Ph.D. student at the University of Kentucky studying biogeography. Informed by her background in biology and library science, she seeks to combine life history and environmental data to understand spatiotemporal patterns in biodiversity. Using this methodology, her ultimate goal is to build better relationships between academia and conservation practitioners for a more environmentally resilient future. Newly active in the TDWG community, Kimberly is eager to find new ways to think about biodiversity data and the people who generate it.

  <b>Visotheary Ung</b><br />
As the head of BIRD, Theary's role is to assist researchers in their development projects in Biodiversity Informatics. It covers various activities like overseeing potential funding opportunities, helping define and write their specifications, hiring personnel and managing their projects on a daily basis.
Her research is focussed on applying comparative biogeography methods to different regions of the globe with a special interest in Southeast Asia and the West Pacific region. Because she is very much interested in standardisation and interoperability, she is developing an ontology for biogeographic areas, which will facilitate their use.
She also provides technical support to their webmaster, Françoise Lopez and is Secretary for the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG).
