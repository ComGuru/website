## Brenda Daly

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3732-8339)

__South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), Capetown, South Africa__

__Background__

Brenda Daly is the Information Systems Manager for the Biodiversity Information and Planning Directorate at the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), with 16 years’ experience in information management and digital curation. She leads several projects in the delivery of operational systems which includes external-facing availability of applications, infrastructure and data. Brenda also provides strategic technical leadership in implementing SANBI’s enterprise information architecture to integrate South African biodiversity information.

Prior to her appointment at SANBI, Brenda was the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Node Manager for the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) a Non-Profit Organisation dedicated to conserving threatened species and ecosystems in southern Africa. It was her engagement with the GBIF community that introduced her to the internationally recognised data standards and the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) community.

__Vision statement__

With a genuine enthusiasm for information technology and a passion for biodiversity, Brenda’s research interest is the importance of biodiversity data in addressing research and decision-making in the use and management of living resources and how these data can be shared in a more effective and appropriate platform for any type of use or application.  It is therefore vital that biodiversity information standards are adapted to allow for this.

__National Museums of Kenya, Kenya__

__Background__

Joining the museum community has since cultivated a love for biodiversity and cultural
Heritage informatics. At the National Museums of Kenya, fusing Information technology
with science has been a great challenging experience where I work as the chief information
officer. I am involved in various digitization initiatives within the institution and advocate for
data sharing, attribution while also building capacity on various areas of biodiversity
informatics with emphasis on data quality assurance. I am currently the technical advisor for
Biodiversity Heritage Library Africa, promoting digitization of biodiversity heritage literature
in the region, and the Node manager for GBIF Kenya

__Vision Statement__

TDWG plays a vital role in the development and maintenance of standards.
As a TDWG member, through my engagement as Node Manager and a technical advisor for
BHL Africa, I will focus on building capacity on greater understanding and use of the
standards, its implementation and support the interests of partners and collaborators
in the African region within TDWG.
