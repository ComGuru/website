Nominations are open for positions on the [Executive Committee](../) of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) for terms spanning 2022-2023.

This is an opportunity to lead the development of biodiversity informatics and work with an enthusiastic team to improve the quality and interoperability of biodiversity data.

TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. TDWG also publishes the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published. The TDWG Executive Committee oversees the work of TDWG. It coordinates TDWG's Interest and Task Groups, manages the review and ratification of standards, manages the organization’s journal, and organizes the annual meeting. These responsibilities are set forth in the [Constitution](/about/constitution/) and detailed further in a [supplementary document](../responsibilities/).

Positions on the executive are staggered two-year terms, such that no more than half of the Committee will be new each year. Towards the end of every calendar year, TDWG holds elections for terms that are expiring and need to be filled for the coming year. Officers elected this year will serve terms in the caledar years 2022 and 2023. The the schedule and procedures for nominations and the election are detailed below, followed by open positions, their responsibilities, and nominees.

## Nomination procedure

To nominate someone for one of the positions above, first confirm that the nominee is willing to accept the responsibilities of the office.  Then work with the nominee to send a brief statement of the nominee’s background and vision (maximum 400 words) to the TDWG Secretary ([secretary@tdwg.org](mailto:secretary@tdwg.org)).  Self nominations are accepted.  All nominations must be complete and received before **1 November 2021**.

## Election procedure

The TDWG Secretariat will post the names of nominees below and with links to their statements background and vision.  Shortly after nominations are closed, the Secretariat will distribute ballots to all institutional and individual members in good standing.  In the case of institutional members, we will notify the primary and secondary contacts, but only one ballot response will be accepted. If you are uncertain about your membership status, please inquire with the TDWG Treasurer ([treasurer@tdwg.org](mailto:treasurer@tdwg.org)). Institutional ballots will be weighted as five individual ballots.

**Dr. Patricia Mergen, Botanical Garden, Meise, Belgium**

As a member of the Association of International Associations based in Belgium and many contacts with the "Meet in" or "visit" or "Tourism" (town, country) I am happy to have TDWG continue to benefit from those connections to find support for venues. Additionally the contacts with the local scientific, technical potential hosts is very important within our network.

If elected, I would continue to act as a relay between potential hosts and TDWG Executive. The goal remains to have venues identified on a 3 to 5 years horizon. I would also continue to push regional representatives to play a bigger role in this committee and other TDWG members to mobilise participation to TDWG in their regions and participate in the annual conference and also to become active in the TG and IG.
