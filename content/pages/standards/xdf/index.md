**Abstract:** XDF (the Exchange Data Format) is a database file exchange medium to handle diverse classes of biological data required for file transfers between different database projects. Data sets prepared in XDF consists of text files that are effectively independent of any particular project. XDF is a high-level language for describing biological data, with its own syntax and command vocabulary, analogous to the high-level programming languages used to describe software algorithms.  \
