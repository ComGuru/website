## Public review of Darwin Core maintenance proposals ends

The initial 30-day Darwin Core review (with a one-day bonus) is now over. The Darwin Core Maintenance Group has reviewed the proposals that were under consideration and has considered that consensus has been achieved on 30 issues (https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/labels/Process%20-%20prepare%20for%20Executive%20review), which will now be put forward for ratification.

Ten issues remain controversial. Of these, six have been recommended to go to task groups for resolution (occurrenceStatus, occurrenceStatus controlled vocabulary, preparations, disposition, associatedSequences, biome). The other four contentious issues (individualCount, verbatimLabel, identificationQualifier, subgenus) will remain open under public review for another 30 days in pursuit of consensus so as not to lose any momentum. None of these ten issues will be included in the release resulting from this public review, which will proceed with the changes embodied in the aforementioned 30 resolved issues.

Preparations are now under way for a release candidate to be presented to the TDWG Executive Committee for approval with the assistance of the Technical Architecture Group. Once presented, the Executive Committee has 30 days within which to decide to ratify all, part, or none of the proposed release.


## Darwin Core hour (webinar): maintenance proposals - details and discussion

An essential step in maintaining a TDWG standard is the public review of changes or enhancements that have been proposed by members of the community. TDWG's public reviews are typically 30 days and enable stakeholders to review and comment on proposed modifications. The Darwin Core Maintenance Group usually schedules two public reviews per year to cover pending issues and proposals. On behalf of the Darwin Core Hour and the TDWG Outreach & Communication sub-committee, the the Darwin Core Maintenance Group will hold two webinars this summer. Each webinar will be conducted twice to give our global community a chance to participate. The first webinar we will focus on the last public review of 40 proposals and present the next steps for the various issues according to review results. After the results have been reviewed, participants will have time for ask questions and discuss the proposals being advanced for ratification, as well as those still under review.
